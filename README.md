# runderground-tube-challenge

The runderground (for Paris) or the Tube Challenge (for London) is the challenge to reach the fastest time to travel to all underground stations.

There is absolutely no goal other than fun and maybe, quite frankly, doing something a tad stupid (but fun!).

It is tracked as a Guinness World Record since 1960 and has its own Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_Challenge

The rules are:

- you have to go through all the stations of the underground (270 in London, 302 in Paris) - you might go through some stations multiple times
- if a station is undergoing works and the subway you're in goes through it slowly without stopping, it is still validated
- you have to go through each station on the subway or on feet to validate it
- the timer starts when the subway doors close in the first station and stops when you walk out of the subway into the last station
- you should be able to produce a detailed report of your journey afterwards: who participated, who saw you if relevant, time in and out of each station and specific changes in mode of travel (switching lines, walking, etc.), and a picture of the station validating the milestone, for the entirety of the journey

Equipment

You can only use the subway, your legs and other public transportation means (RER, overground, tram, bus) to move around the city: no cab, no car, no skateboard, no roller blades, no bike, no hitch-hiking. Crutches are accepted if you have a good reason to have them with you (but then, you should probably not be doing this).

My goal for this project is, ideally, to create an app (that's the interface) that is able to do the following things, for both cities:

- tell me the path to take that is the fastest, including where to start
- ideally be able to do this calculation at any given moment (i.e. in real-time)
- compare with the world records
- adjust the estimates to my observed walking / running speed
- run simulations over different dates and different times to try to look for patterns in the best achievable time (starting station, time of the day, day of the month, etc.)

Please don't hesitate to comment, and... wish me luck!
